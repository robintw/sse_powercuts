# SSE Powercuts Git Scraper
Scrapes the information on powercuts for the Scottish and Southern Energy supplier and stores it
in this Git repo, as JSON.

SSE displays data on their webpage at https://www.ssen.co.uk/Powertrack/, which comes from this
API: https://www.ssen.co.uk/Sse_Components/Views/Controls/FormControls/PowerTrackHandler.ashx.

Very much inspired by (and almost an exact copy of): https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/
