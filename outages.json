It also means it's not safe for us to complete repairs at this time and we also need to assess the extent of damage caused to then be able to restore your power. At this stage, we're unable to provide an estimated time of restoration, however, our teams are working as hard as they can to assess the situation and provide you with a realistic timescale. Once we've assessed the situation, we'll add the expected restoration time here, so please register for updates on this fault and we'll let you know if anything changes.

It also means it's not safe for us to complete repairs at this time and we also need to assess the extent of damage caused to then be able to restore your power. At this stage, we're unable to provide an estimated time of restoration, however, our teams are working as hard as they can to assess the situation and provide you with a realistic timescale. Once we've assessed the situation, we'll add the expected restoration time here, so please register for updates on this fault and we'll let you know if anything changes.

At this stage, we're unable to provide an estimated time of restoration, however, our teams are working as hard as they can to assess the situation and provide you with a realistic timescale.
