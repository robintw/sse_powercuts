At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 23:00 15/05/2024. If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>We have had reports of damage to our network. When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on.
