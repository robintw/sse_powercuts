      "message": "We're very sorry for the power cut. As you'll know, Storm Isha hit the UK overnight, bringing adverse weather conditions. With strong wind speeds like this, trees and debris can hit our lines and then this causes your power to go off – we believe this is what's impacting your power. We made good progress overnight remotely moving our network around to get power restored to large numbers of properties, however, repairs are required to get power back on for everyone. Our engineers have been out since first light, assessing and starting repairs, where possible, to our network. There is a large volume of faults their responding to, and this does mean there can be delays in getting available engineers to the area, along with any restrictions caused by the storm to travel routes. Our engineers are aware of your power cut though and we're doing everything we can to get your power back on.<br/><br/>We'll be keeping this page updated with the latest information, and the estimated restoration time you can see is the latest information we have. You can also register for live updates on this page, so we'll text you the moment anything changes. We know this is a long time without power and promise we're doing everything in our control to get the lights back on.<br/><br/>If you need any additional support, send us a message on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and a member of the team will be happy to help.",

It's not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>Our engineers are in your local area and working hard to get your power restored as soon as possible. At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 21:00 23/01/2024. If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>We have had reports of a overhead power line coming down. When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on.

Whilst responding to Storm Isha, we have also been preparing for this storm which has followed shortly behind.

We do this by remotely moving the flow of electricity around our network so that we can get the lights back on for as many customers as possible. Customers who are located near the damaged part of our network are then the customers who remain off longer until a repair is completed.<br/><br/>Thank you for your ongoing patience and if you require any additional help or support, we're on hand 24 hours a day.
