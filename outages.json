At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 10:00 29/11/2024.<br/><br/>We have had reports of a overhead power line coming down. When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on. These type of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams which is why the restoration time seems so far away.
