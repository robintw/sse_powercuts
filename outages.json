Our team of hundreds of engineers are still out throughout today in the last sprint effort to get every home and business back on power.<br><br>We're aiming to have power restored to almost every property by the end of the day on Monday. The damage to our network is severe and, in some cases, our engineers are needing to rebuild whole parts of the network which is why it's taken so long to get your power back on. We know some customers have been without power for some time now but we promise we're doing everything in our power to get things sorted sooner. We won't be standing down our teams until every single customer has their power back on.<br><br>As offered over the weekend, our support services including food reimbursement, welfare units, warm hubs and accommodation remain on offer for you.

This means that you and some of your neighbours will be affected by the power cut, but not all - this is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power when you do not. Its not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>Due to a busier than usual day, all of our engineers are currently working on other faults. We have made the local teams aware of your power cut and they are working hard to find resources to attend and get your power back on. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by .<br/><br/>The cause of this issue is low voltage on the network powering your home. There are various reasons for why this could happen, and our engineers will get to the bottom of the cause, however, in many cases, it is because there is either a fault on our network which is not allowing enough electricity to travel through the cables, or there is too much electricity being used in the local area. Either way, the team working on this fault will get it sorted and will have your power back to normal as soon as possible. In the meantime, you should try to avoid using any non-essential appliances (such as washing machines and tumble dryers) this should mean your other appliances are able to work more effectively.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'QG5735'",
