We are working with our engineers to fix the problem as quickly as possible, and well keep you updated here on PowerTrack.<br/><br/>It's busier than usual just now, but we'll be sending our engineers to the area as soon as possible.

This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues.
