The strong wind speeds impact our overhead lines, or trees and debris can hit our lines causing them to disconnect. We have significantly increased the number of engineers who are working hard to get the power back on, but they have to do this safely and this means at times, our engineers won’t be able to climb poles if the wind speeds are too high.<br><br>Whilst our engineers assess any damage and make repairs, our control room is also looking at ways to be able to restore your power by moving the network around remotely to re-route power to your area – this isn’t always a possibility, but often gets large numbers of customers back on leaving a small number without power close to where to the damage to our network has occurred.<br><br>Due to the sheer extent of damage the weather brings, it means it may take longer than normal to get power back on. We understand the restoration time you see is a long time away, however, we want to provide you with a realistic timescale so you can make alternative arrangements if you wish.<br><br>Our engineers are keeping us updated with any progress they make, and we’ll update any changes to the restoration time here.

We are working with our engineers to fix the problem as quickly as possible, and will keep you updated here on Power Track.<br/><br/>Engineers are on the way and will arrive in the area at 17:39 10/12/2025. When they get there, they'll work hard to fix the problem as quickly as possible. We'll keep you updated with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power back on by 19:30 10/12/2025.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our overhead network. This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to get your power back on by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may take us longer to fix. If this does happen, we will let you know.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'SF4904'",
