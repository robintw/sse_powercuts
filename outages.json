This unplanned fault is affecting a large area, and it's likely several streets in your area are affected by the same power cut.<br/><br/>Our engineers are in your local area and working hard to get your power restored as soon as possible. At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 05:00 10/12/2024. If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our overhead network.

In most cases, our engineers are able to get your power back on by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may take us longer to fix.
