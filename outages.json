With strong wind speeds like this, trees and debris can hit our lines and then this causes your power to go off – we believe this is what's impacting your power. We made good progress overnight remotely moving our network around to get power restored to large numbers of properties, however, repairs are required to get power back on for everyone. Our engineers have been out since first light, assessing and starting repairs, where possible, to our network. There is a large volume of faults their responding to, and this does mean there can be delays in getting available engineers to the area, along with any restrictions caused by the storm to travel routes. Our engineers are aware of your power cut though and we're doing everything we can to get your power back on.<br/><br/>We'll be keeping this page updated with the latest information, and the estimated restoration time you can see is the latest information we have. You can also register for live updates on this page, so we'll text you the moment anything changes. We know this is a long time without power and promise we're doing everything in our control to get the lights back on.<br/><br/>If you need any additional support, send us a message on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and a member of the team will be happy to help.",

This means that you and some of your neighbours will be affected by the power cut, but not all - this is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power when you do not. It's not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>Due to a busier than usual day, all of our engineers are currently working on other faults. We have made the local teams aware of your power cut and they are working hard to find resources to attend and get your power back on. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 12:00 23/01/2024.<br/><br/>The cause of this issue is low voltage on the network powering your home. There are various reasons for why this could happen and our engineers will get to the bottom of the cause, however, in many cases, it is because there is either a fault on our network which is not allowing enough electricity to travel through the cables, or there is too much electricity being used in the local area. Either way, the team working on this fault will get it sorted and will have your power back to normal as soon as possible. In the meantime, you should try to avoid using any non-essential appliances - this should mean your other appliances are able to work more effectively.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'NF8636'",

At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 01:30 23/01/2024. If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>We have had reports of a overhead power line coming down. When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on. These type of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams which is why the restoration time seems so far away. If we can restore power sooner, we promise we will do so.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'NF8130'",
