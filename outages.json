At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 19:30 10/10/2024. If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>We have had to isolate your power due to a safety concern on our network. Where possible, we will always try to keep the power on, however, there are situations like this where we need to isolate the power to keep people safe.
