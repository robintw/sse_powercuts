This means that you and some of your neighbours will be affected by the power cut, but not all - this is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power when you do not. Its not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>We have notified an engineer of your power cut and are working with them to provide a more accurate update. Once we have this information, we will update this message. You can register for updates on this outage on this page too. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by .<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on one of the cables that come into your home. For some customers, you will have a complete power cut, for others, you may notice just some of your power or appliances not working. This is the a common type of fault we see and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to restore power by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may result in us needing to make full repairs which can take longer. If this does happen, we will let you know.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'QN8538'",
