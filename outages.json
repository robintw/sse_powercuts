This means that you and some of your neighbours will be affected by the power cut, but not all - this is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power when you do not. Its not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>Our engineers are in your local area and working hard to get your power restored as soon as possible. At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 16:00 24/01/2025. If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our underground network. This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to get your power back on by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may take us longer to fix. If this does happen, we will let you know.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'QF8297'",

      "message": "We're aware of a power cut in this area. As you'll know, Storm &Eacute;owyn is bringing harsh weather conditions across much of the country and this weather is causing damage to our power lines. With extreme wind speeds like this, trees and debris can hit our lines and then this causes your power to go off. Due to the weather, it's unsafe for us to assess damage or complete much repair work until it eases off, so this is why our restoration estimate seems a long time away. We will be remotely moving the network around to attempt to get your power back on sooner, with the aim of getting as many properties as possible back on power sooner. The moment it's safe to do so, our engineers will be on the ground fixing the problem. Our teams are working as hard as they can to safely get the lights back on, so thank you for bearing with us.<br><br>We'll be keeping this page updated with the latest information, and the estimated restoration time you can see is the latest information we have. You can also register for live updates on this page, so we'll text you the moment anything changes. We know this is a long time without power and promise we're doing everything in our control to get your power back on.<br><br>If you need any additional support, send us a message on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and a member of the team will be happy to help.",
