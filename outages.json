As many will know, yesterday's weather caused significant damage to our network, and this resulted in a large number of power cuts.

We're aiming to have the power restored to all homes this afternoon and there is a estimated restoration time you can see for your power cut on this page.<br/><br/>As part of our support package, if you've been without power for 12 hours, you're entitled to claim Â£30 per person for food and drink for every day you're without power.
