It's not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>We have engineers on the way and they are due to arrive in your local area at 11:00 09/05/2024.

At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 13:00 09/05/2024.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our underground network. This is the most common type of fault we see and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to restore power by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may result in us needing to make full repairs which can take longer.
