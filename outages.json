This is affecting a large area and it's likely several streets in your area are affected by the same outage.<br/><br/>We have engineers on the way and they are due to arrive in your local area at 11:00 21/04/2024. Once they arrive, they will get straight to work on investigating the fault and attempt to restore your power. We will continue to update this message with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by .<br/><br/>The cause of this issue is low voltage on the network powering your home. There are various reasons for why this could happen and our engineers will get to the bottom of the cause, however, in many cases, it is because there is either a fault on our network which is not allowing enough electricity to travel through the cables, or there is too much electricity being used in the local area. Either way, the team working on this fault will get it sorted and will have your power back to normal as soon as possible. In the meantime, you should try to avoid using any non-essential appliances - this should mean your other appliances are able to work more effectively.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'NS5802'",
