      "message": "We're sorry about the power cut in the area. The power cut is affecting some properties in the area shown on the map, but not all. This is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power, but you don't. It is normal to see 1 in 3 homes affected. We are working with our engineers to fix the problem as quickly as possible, and well keep you updated here on PowerTrack.<br/><br/>We'll be sending our engineers to the area as soon as possible. When they're on their way, we'll let you know what time they'll be arriving. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power back on by18:00 20/08/2025.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our  network. This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to get your power back on by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may take us longer to fix. If this does happen, we will let you know.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'RP0269'",
