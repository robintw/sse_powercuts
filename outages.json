      "message": "We’re aware of a power cut in this area. As you’ll know, Storm Floris is bringing harsh weather conditions across much of Scotland and this weather is causing damage to our power lines. With wind speeds like this, trees and debris can hit our lines and then this causes your power to go off. Due to the weather, it’s sometimes unsafe for us to assess damage or complete much repair work until it eases off, so this is why our restoration estimate seems a long time away. We will be remotely moving the network around to attempt to get your power back on sooner, with the aim of getting as many properties as possible back on power sooner. The moment it’s safe to do so, our engineers will be on the ground fixing the problem. Our teams are working as hard as they can to safely get the lights back on, sothank you for bearing with us.<br><br>We’ll be keeping this page updated with the latest information, and the estimated restoration time you can see is the latest best estimate we have. You can also register for live updates on this page, so we’ll text you the moment anything changes. We know this is a long time without power and promise we’re doing everything in our control to get your power back on.<br><br>If you need any additional support, <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">send us a message on WhatsApp</a> or call us on 105 and a member of the team will be happy to help.",
