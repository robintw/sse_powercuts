When they get there, they'll work hard to fix the problem as quickly as possible. We'll keep you updated with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power back on by 20:00 06/10/2025.<br/><br/>We have had reports of an overhead power line coming down. When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on. These types of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams which is why the restoration time seems so far away. If we can restore power sooner, we promise we will do so.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'RU8973'",

      "message": "This power cut has been caused due to the strong winds and adverse weather conditions Storm Amy is bringing across much of Scotland. The strong winds have caused damage to our electricity network, most likely a tree or large branch hitting our wires. The wind is so strong that in some places it’s not safe for our engineers to climb the poles to fix the problem. Because of this, it’s going to take us longer than normal to get the power back on. We know that this is a very long time but in previous storms, customers have told us they prefer to have this information at the start of a power cut so they can make alternative plans.\n \nOur teams are working as hard as they can to get the power back on, and although our engineers may not be able to fix the problem right away, they are constantly reviewing the reports of damage to the network coming in and planning exactly how they’ll get the power back on as quickly as possible. Many engineers have already been moved to various locations across Scotland before the storm so they’re ready to respond the minute it’s safe to do so. If we can get your power back on sooner, we will.\n \nWe’ll continue to update the progress of this power cut here, and if you would like to be notified of any changes, you can do that by registering for updates at the bottom of this page.\n\nIf you’re going to struggle at all without the power due to a medical condition or there’s something you need extra support with, please send us a message or call us on 105 and one of the team will be on hand to help 24 hours a day.\n \nThank you for your ongoing patience, understanding and support whilst our teams work around the clock to get the lights back on.",

At this stage, we're aiming to have your power back on by20:00 07/10/2025.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our overhead network. This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues.
