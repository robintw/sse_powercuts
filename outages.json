      "message": "We're aware of a fault on our local network affecting several homes. This means that you and some of your neighbours will be affected by the power cut, but not all - this is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power when you do not. Its not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>We have engineers on the way and they are due to arrive in your local area at 01:15 27/11/2024. Once they arrive, they will get straight to work on investigating the fault and attempt to restore your power. We will continue to update this message with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 04:00 27/11/2024.<br/><br/>You may have noticed your power going on and off. This is nothing to worry about but is being caused by a fault on our network. The typical cause for this issue is that something is touching our overhead network - it is usually a tree branch. Our teams are locating the source of the problem as we speak and once we resolve the issue, your power will return to normal. In the meantime, we'd suggest turning off any sensitive appliances like computers and TVs.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'PW3411'",
