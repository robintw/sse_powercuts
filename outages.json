Once they have restored power on the other fault, or if another team become available in the meantime, they will be sent straight to your area to get the power back on.

This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to get your power back on by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may take us longer to fix.
