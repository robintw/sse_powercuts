This unplanned fault is affecting the local area, and it's likely several streets in the area are affected by the same power cut.<br/><br/>We have engineers on the way and they are due to arrive in your local area at 16:00 24/06/2025. Once they arrive, they will get straight to work on investigating the fault and attempt to restore your power. We will continue to update this message with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 21:00 24/06/2025.<br/><br/>We have had to isolate your power due to a safety concern on our network. Where possible, we will always try to keep the power on, however, there are situations like this where we need to isolate the power to keep people safe. There is no concern for safety at your property, however, there is an isolated issue elsewhere our teams need to make safe before they can turn your power back on.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'RC2284'",
