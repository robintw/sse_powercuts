It's not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>We have notified an engineer of your power cut and are working with them to provide a more accurate update.

At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 22:40 24/01/2024.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our underground network.

We appreciate for some customers, you may have also been impacted by Storm Isha and understand how difficult this may be for you. Whilst responding to Storm Isha, we have also been preparing for this storm which has followed shortly behind. We have teams on hand to respond to the weather and the moment it's safe to do so, our engineers will continue to work around the clock to get your power back on and we will provide updates here with any new information.<br/><br/>In the background, we'll also be switching our network to restore power to as many homes as possible. We do this by remotely moving the flow of electricity around our network so that we can get the lights back on for as many customers as possible. Customers who are located near the damaged part of our network are then the customers who remain off longer until a repair is completed.<br/><br/>Thank you for your ongoing patience and if you require any additional help or support, we're on hand 24 hours a day.

If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>We have had reports of a tree falling on our overhead network. When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on. These type of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams, such as tree cutters, which is why the restoration time seems so far away. If we can restore power sooner, we promise we will do so.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'NG1849'",
