Its not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>Our engineers are in your local area and working hard to get your power restored as soon as possible. At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 17:00 19/09/2024. If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>This fault is part of a planned power cut which is taking us longer than expected to restore due to a secondary fault we've located.
