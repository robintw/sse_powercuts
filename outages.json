Due to this we currently cannot guarantee electricity supplies will be restored soon. Our workforce, which was enhanced in preparation for the storm, has been mobilised and we’re working hard to restore customer supplies as quickly and safely as possible. The first priority will be to get the power restored to as many homes as possible by altering our network around the damage - this may mean your power is restored sooner than stated on this fault. Updates for this job will be provided when accurate information is received from colleagues in the field.<br/><br/>For updates on what we’re doing to restore power and how we’re responding to the storm, along with helpful advice, please <a href=\"https://www.ssen.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">click here<a/>.",
