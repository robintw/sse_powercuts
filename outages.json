This is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power, but you don't. It is normal to see 1 in 3 homes affected. We are working with our engineers to fix the problem as quickly as possible, and well keep you updated here on PowerTrack.<br/><br/>Engineers have arrived in the area. They are working hard to fix the problem and will get your power back on as quickly as possible. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power back on by 16:00 28/07/2025. If this changes, we'll let you know.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our underground network. This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to get your power back on by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may take us longer to fix. If this does happen, we will let you know.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'RJ2857'",

When they get there, they'll work hard to fix the problem as quickly as possible. We'll keep you updated with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power back on by 16:00 28/07/2025.<br/><br/>We have had reports of damage to our network. When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on. These types of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams, such as tree cutters, which is why the restoration time seems so far away.
