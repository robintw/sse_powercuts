This unplanned fault is affecting the local area, and it's likely several streets in the area are affected by the same power cut.<br/><br/>Our engineers are in your local area and working hard to get your power restored as soon as possible. You can register for updates on this outage on this page too.<br/><br/>We have had to isolate your power due to a safety concern on our network. Where possible, we will always try to keep the power on, however, there are situations like this where we need to isolate the power to keep people safe. There is no concern for safety at your property, however, there is an isolated issue elsewhere our teams need to make safe before they can turn your power back on.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'RE6354'",
