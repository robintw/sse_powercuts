We are working with our engineers to fix the problem as quickly as possible, and well keep you updated here on PowerTrack.<br/><br/>Engineers are on the way and will arrive in the area at 08:30 04/08/2025. When they get there, they'll work hard to fix the problem as quickly as possible. We'll keep you updated with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power back on by 13:00 04/08/2025.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our underground network. This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to get your power back on by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may take us longer to fix.

      "message": "We’re aware of a power cut in this area. As you’ll know, Storm Floris is bringing harsh weather conditions across much of Scotland and this weather is causing damage toour power lines. With wind speeds like this, trees and debris can hit our lines and then this causes your power to go off. Due to the weather, it’s sometimes unsafe for us to assess damage or complete much repair work until it eases off, so this is why our restoration estimate seems a long time away.
