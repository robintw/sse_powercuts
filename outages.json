Once they arrive, they will get straight to work on investigating the fault and attempt to restore your power. We will continue to update this message with any new information.

When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on. These type of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams, such as tree cutters, which is why the restoration time seems so far away.
