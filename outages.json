Whilst responding to Storm Isha, we have also been preparing for this storm which has followed shortly behind. We have teams on hand to respond to the weather and the moment it's safe to do so, our engineers will continue to work around the clock to get your power back on and we will provide updates here with any new information.<br/><br/>In the background, we'll also be switching our network to restore power to as many homes as possible. We do this by remotely moving the flow of electricity around our network so that we can get the lights back on for as many customers as possible. Customers who are located near the damaged part of our network are then the customers who remain off longer until a repair is completed.<br/><br/>Thank you for your ongoing patience and if you require any additional help or support, we're on hand 24 hours a day.
