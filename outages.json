Due to high wind speeds across central southern England, we're dealing with a higher number of faults than usual and this means it may take us a little longer to get your power back on than we'd usually expect. The likely cause of your power cut is a tree branch or debris hitting our power line. Our teams are working hard to get your power restored and at this stage, we believe they will have your power restored by the time provided above. We know this is a long time and if we can restore power sooner, we will – this is typically done in stages. Thank you for your ongoing patience and understanding. If you need extra help or support, please call us on 105.",
