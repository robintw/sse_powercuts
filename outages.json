At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 04:00 12/06/2024.

This is the most common type of fault we see and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to restore power by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may result in us needing to make full repairs which can take longer.
