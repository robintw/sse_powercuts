This means that you and some of your neighbours will be affected by the power cut, but not all - this is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power when you do not. It's not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>Our engineers are in your local area and working hard to get your power restored as soon as possible. At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 11:00 24/01/2024. If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our underground network. This is the most common type of fault we see and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to restore power by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may result in us needing to make full repairs which can take longer.

It's not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>Our engineers are in your local area and working hard to get your power restored as soon as possible. At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 16:00 24/01/2024. If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on one of the cables that come into your home. For some customers, you will have a complete power cut, for others, you may notice just some of your power or appliances not working. This is the a common type of fault we see and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to restore power by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may result in us needing to make full repairs which can take longer.

It's not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>Engineers are aware of the fault but are busy on another fault. Once they have restored power on the other fault, or if another team become available in the meantime, they will be sent straight to your area to get the power back on.

When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on.

      "message": "We're sorry for the power cut affecting your property. Storm Jocelyn is now impacting our network and bringing with it more strong winds and is the likely cause of your power cut. We appreciate for some customers, you may have also been impacted by Storm Isha and understand how difficult this may be for you. Whilst responding to Storm Isha, we have also been preparing for this storm which has followed shortly behind. We have teams on hand to respond to the weather and the moment it's safe to do so, our engineers will continue to work around the clock to get your power back on and we will provide updates here with any new information.<br/><br/>In the background, we'll also be switching our network to restore power to as many homes as possible. We do this by remotely moving the flow of electricity around our network so that we can get the lights back on for as many customers as possible. Customers who are located near the damaged part of our network are then the customers who remain off longer until a repair is completed.<br/><br/>Thank you for your ongoing patience and if you require any additional help or support, we're on hand 24 hours a day. Send us a message <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and one of the team will be happy to help.",
