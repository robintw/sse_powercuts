This means that you and some of your neighbours will be affected by the power cut, but not all - this is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power when you do not. It's not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>We have engineers on the way and they are due to arrive in your local area at 09:30 23/01/2024. Once they arrive, they will get straight to work on investigating the fault and attempt to restore your power. We will continue to update this message with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 14:30 23/01/2024.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our overhead network. This is the most common type of fault we see and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to restore power by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may result in us needing to make full repairs which can take longer. If this does happen, we will let you know<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'NF9552'",

It's not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>Due to a busier than usual day, all of our engineers are currently working on other faults. We have made the local teams aware of your power cut and they are working hard to find resources to attend and get your power back on. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 14:30 23/01/2024.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our underground network. This is the most common type of fault we see and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to restore power by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may result in us needing to make full repairs which can take longer.

With strong wind speeds like this, trees and debris can hit our lines and then this causes your power to go off – we believe this is what's impacting your power. We made good progress overnight remotely moving our network around to get power restored to large numbers of properties, however, repairs are required to get power back on for everyone. Our engineers have been out since first light, assessing and starting repairs, where possible, to our network. There is a large volume of faults their responding to, and this does mean there can be delays in getting available engineers to the area, along with any restrictions caused by the storm to travel routes. Our engineers are aware of your power cut though and we're doing everything we can to get your power back on.<br/><br/>We'll be keeping this page updated with the latest information, and the estimated restoration time you can see is the latest information we have. You can also register for live updates on this page, so we'll text you the moment anything changes.

It's not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>We have engineers on the way and they are due to arrive in your local area at 09:00 23/01/2024. Once they arrive, they will get straight to work on investigating the fault and attempt to restore your power. We will continue to update this message with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by .<br/><br/>We have had reports of a overhead power line coming down. When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on. These type of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams which is why the restoration time seems so far away.
