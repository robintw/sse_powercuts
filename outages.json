We are working with our engineers to fix the problem as quickly as possible, and well keep you updated here on PowerTrack.<br/><br/>Engineers have arrived in the area. They are working hard to fix the problem and will get your power back on as quickly as possible. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power back on by 19:00 21/10/2025. If this changes, we'll let you know.<br/><br/>You may have noticed your power going on and off. This is nothing to worry about but is being caused by a fault on our network. The typical cause for this issue is that something is touching our overhead network - it is usually a tree branch. Our teams are locating the source of the problem as we speak and once we resolve the issue, your power will return to normal. In the meantime, we'd suggest turning off any sensitive appliances like computers and TVs.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'RX1972'",
