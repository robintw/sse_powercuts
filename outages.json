It's been a busy weekend so far with Storm &Eacute;owyn bringing some harsh weather conditions and the weather has been the worst of this winter so far, and has caused a lot of damage to our electricity network. Because of how strong the wind speeds were, it's also been very difficult for our engineers to access damage or make repairs, however, good progress has now been made on this. Our engineers safety is extremely important, so we have had to wait for the weather to improve before we can climb poles and make repairs.<br><br>In addition to this, the weather makes travel very difficult too as trees and debris can sometimes be blocking roads or access to our network.<br><br>Now the worst of the weather has passed, our engineers have been getting to work on fixing the issues and getting your power back on.<br><br>We know you've been without power for some time now, but we promise we're doing everything in our power to get things sorted as soon as possible.
