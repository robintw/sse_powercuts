There are various reasons for why this could happen, and our engineers will get to the bottom of the cause, however, in many cases, it is because there is either a fault on our network which is not allowing enough electricity to travel through the cables, or there is too much electricity being used in the local area. Either way, the team working on this fault will get it sorted and will have your power back to normal as soon as possible. In the meantime, you should try to avoid using any non-essential appliances (such as washing machines and tumble dryers) this should mean your other appliances are able to work more effectively.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'QC9038'",
