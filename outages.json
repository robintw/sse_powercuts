Throughout yesterday and into last night, our teams were working as hard as they could to get as many properties restored as possible.<br/><br/>Our engineers are back out today prioritising faults based on time off and largest customer numbers. We're aiming to have the power restored to all homes this afternoon and there is a estimated restoration time you can see for your power cut on this page.<br/><br/>As part of our support package, if you've been without power for 12 hours, you're entitled to claim £30 per person for food and drink for every day you're without power. Just keep proof of purchase and submit the claim after your power is back on at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ssen.co.uk/stormclaim/\">www.ssen.co.uk/stormclaim</a>.<br/><br/>We will continue to update this page with any new information and you can register for text updates here too.<br/><br/>If you need any further support, please contact us on 105 or send us a message on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a>",

Its not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>Due to a busier than usual day, all of our engineers are currently working on other faults. We have made the local teams aware of your power cut and they are working hard to find resources to attend and get your power back on. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 19:00 25/11/2024.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on one of the cables that come into your home. For some customers, you will have a complete power cut, for others, you may notice just some of your power or appliances not working. This is the a common type of fault we see and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to restore power by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may result in us needing to make full repairs which can take longer. If this does happen, we will let you know.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'PW0097'",
