Our teams are working hard to restore your power, however, due to weather conditions that have impacted our network, and will continue to do so through to Friday, it may take longer than normal to restore power. We’re experiencing a busier than usual period and the conditions mean that even with additional teams we have mobilised, it’s much harder to repair faults due to the safety implications of working on our network in such conditions.<br/><br/>We will continue to update you with the latest information here on Power Track, so we’d recommend you register for updates on this fault or check back in later.<br/><br/>If you are in need of extra support, such as requiring electricity for medical equipment, you can call us on 105 where our team is on hand to help.<br/><br/>For updates on how we’re dealing with the weather, along with helpful advice, please <a href=\"https://www.ssen.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">click here<a/>.",
