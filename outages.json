This unplanned fault is affecting a large area, and it's likely several streets in your area are affected by the same power cut.<br/><br/>Our engineers are in your local area and working hard to get your power restored as soon as possible.

If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>We have had to isolate your power due to a safety concern on our network.
