As many will know, yesterday's weather caused significant damage to our network, and this resulted in a large number of power cuts. Throughout yesterday and into last night, our teams were working as hard as they could to get as many properties restored as possible.<br/><br/>Our engineers are back out today prioritising faults based on time off and largest customer numbers. We're aiming to have the power restored to all homes this afternoon and there is a estimated restoration time you can see for your power cut on this page.<br/><br/>As part of our support package, if you've been without power for 12 hours, you're entitled to claim £30 per person for food and drink for every day you're without power.
