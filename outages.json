This is affecting a large area and it's likely several streets in your area are affected by the same outage.<br/><br/>Our engineers are in your local area and working hard to get your power restored as soon as possible. At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 23:59 24/01/2024. If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>We have had reports of a tree falling on our overhead network. When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on. These type of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams, such as tree cutters, which is why the restoration time seems so far away. If we can restore power sooner, we promise we will do so.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'NG2022'",
