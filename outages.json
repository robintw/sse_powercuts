This means that you and some of your neighbours will be affected by the power cut, but not all - this is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power when you do not. It's not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>Our engineers are in your local area and working hard to get your power restored as soon as possible. At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 11:00 10/04/2024. If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>You may have noticed your power going on and off. This is nothing to worry about but is being caused by a fault on our network. The typical cause for this issue is that something is touching our overhead network - it is usually a tree branch. Our teams are locating the source of the problem as we speak and once we resolve the issue, your power will return to normal. In the meantime, we'd suggest turning off any sensitive appliances like computers and TVs.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'NR4487'",
