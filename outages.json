We are working with our engineers to fix the problem as quickly as possible, and well keep you updated here on PowerTrack.<br/><br/>Engineers have arrived in the area. They are working hard to fix the problem and will get your power back on as quickly as possible. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power back on by 12:00 25/08/2025. If this changes, we'll let you know.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our underground network. This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to get your power back on by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may take us longer to fix.
