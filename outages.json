This means that you and some of your neighbours will be affected by the power cut, but not all - this is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power when you do not. Its not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>We have engineers on the way and they are due to arrive in your local area at 10:00 20/10/2024. Once they arrive, they will get straight to work on investigating the fault and attempt to restore your power. We will continue to update this message with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 12:00 20/10/2024.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our overhead network. This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to get your power back on by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may take us longer to fix. If this does happen, we will let you know.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'PR4416'",

At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 13:30 20/10/2024.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our overhead network. This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to get your power back on by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may take us longer to fix. If this does happen, we will let you know.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'PR4501'",

We expect the cause of this to be from the strong winds and heavy rain Storm Ashley is bringing across our network. We've been tracking this weather for several days and have additional teams on hand to respond. It's possible that either the wind or rain has caused damage to our network and our teams will need to repair this as and when it's safe to do so.<br/><br/>Our local engineers have been informed this area is without power and are working hard to get the lights back on. We will continue to issue updates to the restoration time here and suggest you register for updates on this page so we can notify you if anything changes.<br/><br/>Thank you for your patience and if you need any help or additional information in the meantime, please call us by dialling 105 or send us a message on WhatsApp.",
