This means that you and some of your neighbours will be affected by the power cut, but not all - this is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power when you do not. Its not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>We have notified an engineer of your power cut and are working with them to provide a more accurate update. Once we have this information, we will update this message. You can register for updates on this outage on this page too. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 23:00 29/03/2025.<br/><br/>We have had reports of damage to our network. When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on. These type of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams, such as tree cutters, which is why the restoration time seems so far away. If we can restore power sooner, we promise we will do so.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'QR2838'",
