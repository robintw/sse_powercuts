      "message": "We're aware of a fault causing customers in the area to be without power. We expect the cause of this to be from the strong winds and weather conditions Storm Darragh is bringing across our network. We've been tracking this weather for several days and have additional teams on hand to respond. It's possible that the weather has caused damage to our network and our teams will need to repair this when it's safe to do so.<br><br>Our local engineers have been informed this area is without power and are working hard to get the lights back on. The weather conditions mean that it can be harder than usual to make repairs, and it's important our teams remain safe, which is one of the reasons the restoration time is so long. If we can get the power back on sooner, we will. We are also dealing with a higher than usually volume of faults, and this means our engineers may need to get the power back on somewhere else and then fix the fault affecting your power after.<br><br>We will continue to issue updates to the restoration time here and suggest you register for updates on this page so we can notify you if anything changes.<br><br>Thank you for your patience and if you need any help or additional information in the meantime, please call us by dialling 105 or send us a message on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a>.",
