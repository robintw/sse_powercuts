We are working with our engineers to fix the problem as quickly as possible, and well keep you updated here on PowerTrack.<br/><br/>Engineers have arrived in the area. They are working hard to fix the problem and will get your power back on as quickly as possible. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power back on by 04:30 12/10/2025. If this changes, we'll let you know.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our underground network.
