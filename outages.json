      "message": "We're continuing to reconnect electricity to those who are still without power after Storm Amy's extremely damaging winds. More engineering teams have arrived today from across the country to further reinforce our massive power restoration operation.<br><br>The weather has improved slightly, and this means we have been able to start repairs in some areas and begin to get power restored in stages. There is however a large amount of damage across our network, and this is why you may see a longer restoration time than you were expecting. We appreciate this is a long time, however, want to provide customers with the chance to make alternative arrangements if they wish. Amy has been a particularly severe storm; the Met Office has provisionally said a new low-pressure record for October was set in Shetland, and a gust of 96mph was recorded on Tiree.<br><br>The sustained, storm-force winds have posed considerable challenges; but days of preparations before the storm arrived have ensured reconnection work is progressing as safely and as quickly as it can as and when weather conditions permit. Days of severe wind warnings have finally ended, and the arrival of calmer conditions is allowing work to progress more quickly. However, some access routes are still blocked by fallen trees and storm debris, and this is hindering access to some areas where the network has been damaged.<br><br>Our teams are continuing to work as hard as they can to get the power back on and we're bringing in additional teams to help us speed this up and meet our estimated restoration time we have set.<br><br>We have begun to dispatch welfare units in areas where there are no road restrictions and where it's safe to do so. We are also offering reimbursement of costs for food and drink, and also for hotels where the power has been off for more than 48 hours. You can find out more on this at <a href=\"https://www.ssen.co.uk/stormsupport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ssen.co.uk/stormsupport</a>.<br><br>We'll continue to update the progress of this power cut here, and if you would like to be notified of any changes, you can do that by registering for updates at the bottom of this page.<br><br>If you're going to struggle at all without the power due to a medical condition or there's something you need extra support with, please <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">send us a message on WhatsApp</a> or call us on 105 and one of the team will be on hand to help 24 hours a day.<br><br>Thank you for your ongoing patience, understanding and support whilst our teams work around the clock to get the lights back on.",
