      "message": "We're very sorry for the power cut. As you'll know, Storm Isha is bringing harsh weather conditions across much of the country and this weather is causing damage to our power lines. With strong wind speeds like this, trees and debris can hit our lines and then this causes your power to go off. Due to the weather, it's unsafe for us to complete much repair work until it eases off, so although it's unlikely we'll repair the damage tonight, we will be remotely moving the network around toattempt to get your power back on sooner, with the aim of getting as many properties as possible back on power overnight. At first light, and if it's safe to do so, our engineers will be on the move to start assessment of damage and begin making repairs to get the power backon.<br/><br/>We'll be keeping this page updated with the latest information, and the estimated restoration time you can see is the latest information we have. You can also register for live updates on this page, so we'll text you the moment anything changes. We know this is a long time without power and promise we're doing everything in our control to get the lights back on.<br/><br/>If you need any additional support, send us a message on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and a member of the team will be happy to help.",
