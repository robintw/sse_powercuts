We are working with our engineers to fix the problem as quickly as possible, and well keep you updated here on PowerTrack.<br/><br/>Engineers are on the way and will arrive in the area at 13:00 02/12/2025.

This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues.
