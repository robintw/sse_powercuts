      "message": "We're sorry about the power cut in the area. The power cut is affecting some properties in the area shown on the map, but not all. This is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power, but you don't. It is normal to see 1 in 3 homes affected. We are working with our engineers to fix the problem as quickly as possible, and well keep you updated here on PowerTrack.<br/><br/>Engineers have arrived in the area. They are working hard to fix the problem and will get your power back on as quickly as possible. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power back on by 22:00 12/09/2025. If this changes, we'll let you know.<br/><br/>We have had reports of damage to our network by a third-party which has in turn caused the power to go off in your area. We know where this damage has taken place and our teams are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the damage and get your power back on. These type of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams which is why the restoration time seems so far away. If we can restore power sooner, we promise we will do so.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'RS2069'",
