This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to get your power back on by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may take us longer to fix.

We understand the restoration time you see is a long time away, however, we want to provide you with a realistic timescale so you can make alternative arrangements if you wish.<br><br>Our engineers are keeping us updated with any progress they make, and we’ll update any changes to the restoration time here.
