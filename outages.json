      "message": "We're very sorry for the power cut and are aware of a fault on our local network affecting several homes. This means that you and some of your neighbours will be affected by the power cut, but not all - this is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power when you do not. It's not uncommon to see 1 in 3 homes affected.<br/><br/>We have notified an engineer of your power cut and are working with them to provide a more accurate update. Once we have this information, we will update this message. You can register for updates on this outage on this page too. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 14:30 16/06/2024.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our  network. This is the most common type of fault we see and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to restore power by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may result in us needing to make full repairs which can take longer. If this does happen, we will let you know<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'NY1508'",
