Once they arrive, they will get straight to work on investigating the fault and attempt to restore your power. We will continue to update this message with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 20:00 12/04/2024.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our underground network.
