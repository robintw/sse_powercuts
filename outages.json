At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 20:00 20/06/2024.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our underground network.

At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 19:00 20/06/2024.

This is the most common type of fault we see and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues.
