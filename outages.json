This means that you and some of your neighbours will be affected by the power cut, but not all - this is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power when you do not.

At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 18:00 02/02/2025.

This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues.
