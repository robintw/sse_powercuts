At this stage, based on initial investigations, we're aiming to restore your power by 22:00 03/01/2025. If this changes, we will update this message.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on one of the cables that come into your home.

This is the a common type of fault we see and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to restore power by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may result in us needing to make full repairs which can take longer.
