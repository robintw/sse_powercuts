Once they arrive, they will get straight to work on investigating the fault and attempt to restore your power. We will continue to update this message with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 06:00 28/01/2025.<br/><br/>We have had reports of damage to our network. When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on. These type of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams, such as tree cutters, which is why the restoration time seems so far away. If we can restore power sooner, we promise we will do so.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'QG7118'",

Our team of hundreds of engineers are still out throughout today in the last sprint effort to get every home and business back on power.<br><br>We're aiming to have power restored to almost every property by the end of the day on Monday. The damage to our network is severe and, in some cases, our engineers are needing to rebuild whole parts of the network which is why it's taken so long to get your power back on. We know some customers have been without power for some time now but we promise we're doing everything in our power to get things sorted sooner. We won't be standing down our teams until every single customer has their power back on.<br><br>As offered over the weekend, our support services including food reimbursement, welfare units, warm hubs and accommodation remain on offer for you.
