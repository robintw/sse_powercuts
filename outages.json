We are working with our engineers to fix the problem as quickly as possible, and well keep you updated here on PowerTrack.<br/><br/>We're finding the closest engineer available. They'll be making their way to the area as soon as possible. When they're on their way, we'll let you know what time they'll be arriving. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power back on by11:30 27/07/2025.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our underground network. This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to get your power back on by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may take us longer to fix.
