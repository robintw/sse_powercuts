This means that you and some of your neighbours will be affected by the power cut, but not all - this is why you may notice some of your neighbours have power when you do not.

Once they arrive, they will get straight to work on investigating the fault and attempt to restore your power.

This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues.

Once they arrive, they will get straight to work on investigating the fault and attempt to restore your power.
