We are working with our engineers to fix the problem as quickly as possible, and will keep you updated here on Power Track.<br/><br/>Engineers are on the way and will arrive in the area at 07:45 25/08/2025. When they get there, they'll work hard to fix the problem as quickly as possible. We'll keep you updated with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power back on by 14:00 25/08/2025.<br/><br/>The cause of this power cut is a fault on our overhead network. This is the most common type of fault we see, and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues. In most cases, our engineers are able to get your power back on by simply replacing a fuse at the local substation, however, if the fault is severe, this may take us longer to fix. If this does happen, we will let you know.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'RP4233'",
