It's possible that the weather has caused damage to our network and our teams will need to repair this when it's safe to do so.<br><br>Our local engineers have been informed this area is without power and are working hard to get the lights back on. The weather conditions mean that it can be harder than usual to make repairs, and it's important our teams remain safe, which is one of the reasons the restoration time is so long. If we can get the power back on sooner, we will.

At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 13:30 10/12/2024.<br/><br/>We have had reports of damage to our network by a third-party which has in turn caused the power to go off in your area. We know where this damage has taken place and our teams are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the damage and get your power back on. These type of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams which is why the restoration time seems so far away. If we can restore power sooner, we promise we will do so.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'PY8721'",
