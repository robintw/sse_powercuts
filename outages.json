When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on. These type of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams which is why the restoration time seems so far away.

This unplanned fault is affecting a large area, and it's likely several streets in your area are affected by the same power cut.<br/><br/>We have engineers on the way and they are due to arrive in your local area at 06:10 22/09/2024. Once they arrive, they will get straight to work on investigating the fault and attempt to restore your power. We will continue to update this message with any new information. At this stage, we're aiming to have your power restored by 10:00 22/09/2024.<br/><br/>We have had reports of damage to our network. When this happens, the power will automatically turn off to keep everyone safe. Our engineers know exactly where the problem is and are working hard to make the situation safe, repair the wire and get your power back on. These type of faults often require extensive work and specialist teams, such as tree cutters, which is why the restoration time seems so far away. If we can restore power sooner, we promise we will do so.<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"https://wa.me/447342028546/\">Whatsapp</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'PM2724'",
