This is the most common type of fault we see and our teams are very experienced in dealing with these issues.

If this does happen, we will let you know<br/><br/>If you need more information, please send us a message on <a href=\"http://m.me/ssencommunity/\">Facebook</a> or call us on 105 and quote reference 'NY4243'",
